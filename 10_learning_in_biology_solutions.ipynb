Short-term plasticty <a name=\"stp\"></a>\n","\n","Source: http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Short-term_synaptic_plasticity\n","\n","Although memory formation in the brain is believed to rely primarily on long-lasting changes in synaptic strength and connectivity, shorter-lived modulation of synaptic strength, known as **short-term plasticity (STP)**, also plays an important role.\n","\n","While some artificial models implement STP, it is often neglected in others. This provides us with an opportunity to extend the content of this course to explore the mechanisms underlying STP.\n","\n","You have covered quite some ground on the matter of STP already during the lecture but let usre-emphasise the concepts again.\n","\n","In brief, STP is a phenomenon where synaptic efficacy changes dynamically over time, based on the history of presynaptic activity. As the name suggests, these processes are relatively short-lived, typically lasting for milliseconds.\n","\n","Before delving into the details of a mathematical model describing STP, we first examine its two primary forms:\n","\n","**Facilitation**\n","Presynaptic neurons prepare vesicles containing neurotransmitters, priming them for release upon the arrival of an action potential. This process involves a complex molecular machinery that we will not discuss in detail here. However, it is important to note that this process is calcium-dependent. With each arriving presynaptic action potential, the level of presynaptic calcium increases.\n","\n","If action potentials arrive in close succession, the calcium from one action potential adds to the residual calcium remaining from earlier ones. This cumulative increase in calcium enhances the probability of vesicle release, as long as vesicles remain available. Consequently, the postsynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) becomes larger with successive, closely spaced action potentials.\n","\n","**Depletion**\n","In contrast to facilitation, depletion refers to a decrease in synaptic efficacy due to the depletion of readily releasable vesicles. When a presynaptic action potential arrives, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters from vesicles, but the supply of these vesicles is limited. If action potentials occur at a high frequency, vesicles are released faster than they can be replenished. As a result, subsequent action potentials lead to fewer vesicles being available for release, reducing the postsynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Depletion is therefore a form of short-term plasticity that reflects a transient limitation in presynaptic resources. This effect depends on the balance between vesicle replenishment rates and the frequency of presynaptic activity.\n","\n","---\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.1: Mathematical model <a name=\"mm1\"></a>\n","\n","The following differential equations describe the model proposed by Tsodyks and Markramth for Short-term plasticity (STP).\n","The model uses two variables to describe the internal state of a neuron.\n","First, $x$ describes the fraction of available recources (vesicles in the presynapse).
