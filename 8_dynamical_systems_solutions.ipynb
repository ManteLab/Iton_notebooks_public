We can answer this by ruling out parts of the system that are hard to analyze. Notice that at the edges, the system moves very fast. Fast moving dynamics are hard to analyze because the system often spends very little time in regions with fast moving dynamics. Inversely, <b>slow points</b> and <b>fixed points</b> are locations where the dynamics move very slowly and not at all. We will see later why this is important.
