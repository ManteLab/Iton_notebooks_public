        "\n",
        "In this section, we will define the architecture of the **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** that we will use to train on the Ying Yang dataset. Our ANN will consist of one or more **linear layers** (also known as fully connected layers), with **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** activation functions applied after each layer except the last one.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Components of the Artificial Neural Network\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Linear Layers**: A **linear layer** (also called a fully connected layer) is a basic building block of an ANN. In this layer, each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. Mathematically, a linear layer computes a weighted sum of its inputs and adds a **bias term**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   y = W \\cdot x + b\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "   Where:\n",
        "   - $x$ is the input vector to the layer (from the previous layer or input data),\n",
        "   - $W$ is the weight matrix, which holds the learnable parameters that define the strength of the connections between neurons,\n",
        "   - $b$ is the **bias vector**, an additional learnable parameter that allows the model to shift the activation of neurons,\n",
        "   - $y$ is the output of the linear transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   In a neural network, we update $W$ and $b$ during training to minimize the error between the predicted output and the target values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ReLU Activation Function**: After each linear layer, except for the last one, we apply a **ReLU activation function**. The ReLU function is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x)\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "   This function introduces **non-linearity** into the model, allowing the neural network to learn more complex patterns. ReLU ensures that only positive values pass through, while negative values are set to zero. This helps in training the network by preventing negative activations and enabling sparse activations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The ReLU activation allows the network to learn complex relationships that linear models cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Output Layer**: The final layer does not have any activation function. It produces the **raw outputs** (often called **logits**) of the network, which represent the final predictions for each class. These raw values can later be passed through a **softmax** function to obtain a \"probability\" per class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   The output layer will have as many neurons as the number of classes. In our case, we will have **three neurons** corresponding to the three classes (Yin, Yang, and Two Circles).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Bias Term**: The **bias** term $b$ allows the network to make adjustments to the output, helping the model fit the data better. Without the bias term, all neurons in the same layer would have to pass through the origin, which would limit the expressiveness of the model. The bias term provides a way for neurons to have an output even when all the inputs are zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mathematical Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "If we have an input vector $x$ of size $n$, a linear layer with weights $W$ of size $m \\times n$, and a bias vector $b$ of size $m$, then output $y$ is of size $m$ and is calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{ReLU}(y) = \\text{ReLU}(W \\cdot x + b) = \\max(0, W \\cdot x + b)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, our artificial neural network consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **One or more linear layers** that calculate a weighted sum of inputs plus a bias term.\n",
        "- **ReLU activation functions** applied after each linear layer, except for the last one.\n",
        "- The **final output** is the raw value of the last layerâ€™s neurons (the logits), which represent the predicted class scores. We apply a Softmax function to these scores to obtain the final class probabilities.\n"

        "1. **Convolutional Layers (Conv)**: These layers are commonly used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and are designed to process **grid-like data**, such as images.

This layer is especially useful for problems like image classification or object detection.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Recurrent Layers (RNN, LSTM, GRU)**: These layers are used in **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, which are designed to handle **sequential data** such as time series, speech, or text. Recurrent layers can \"remember\" previous inputs in the sequence and use this memory to influence future predictions.\n",

        "3. **Dropout Layers**: Dropout is a regularization technique where random neurons are \"dropped out\" during training, meaning their connections are temporarily removed. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on specific neurons and helps avoid overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Influence:** Dropout helps improve generalization and prevents overfitting, especially in large models. It forces the network to learn more robust features that are not dependent on specific neurons.\n",

        "   - **Influence:** Batch Normalization helps the model train faster and more effectively by reducing internal covariate shift. It also helps in stabilizing the optimization process, especially when training deep networks.\n",

        "5. **Pooling Layers**: Used mainly in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), pooling layers (like max pooling or average pooling) reduce the dimensionality of the input by summarizing features in a local region, thus reducing computation and making the model more invariant to small translations or distortions in the input.\n",
