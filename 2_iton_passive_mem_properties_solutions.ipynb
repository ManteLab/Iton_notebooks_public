Explain why there is little to no net ion flux at the resting membrane potential. How do the individual ion fluxes of $K^+$ and $Na^{+}$ contribute to maintaining the resting membrane potential?\n",">\n","> 3. Predict what would happen to the membrane potential if the permeability to $Na^{+}$ increased significantly while the permeability to $K^+$ remained constant.\n","\n","\n","<font color='red'> **Solution 1**:</font>\n","\n","At the resting membrane potential of -70 mV, both potassium ($K^+$) and sodium ($Na^+$) ions experience forces driving them across the neuronal membrane due to differences between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and their respective equilibrium potentials ($E_k$ for $K^+$ and $E_{Na}$ for $Na^+$).\n","\n","- Potassium ($K^+$):\n","\n","\tEquilibrium Potential ($E_k$): -90 mV\n","\tDriving Force: $V_m$ - $E_k$ = (-70 mV) - (-90 mV) = +20 mV\n","\n","\tDirection of Movement: The positive driving force indicates that $K^+$ ions are driven out of the cell.\n","\n","  Since the membrane potential is more positive than $E_k$, $K^+$ ions move out of the cell to bring $V_m$ closer to $E_k$, making the inside of the cell more negative.\n","\n","- Sodium ($Na^+$):\n","\n","\tEquilibrium Potential ($E_Na$): +60 mV\n","\n","\tDriving Force: $V_m$ - $E_{Na}$ = (-70 mV) - (+60 mV) = -130 mV\n","\n","\tDirection of Movement: The negative driving force indicates that $Na^+$ ions are driven into the cell.\n","\n","Since the membrane potential is much more negative than $E_{Na}$, $Na^+$ ions move into the cell to bring $V_m$ closer to $E_{Na}$, making the inside of the cell more positive.\n","\n","Therefore, at -70 mV, $K^+$ ions tend to move out of the neuron, while $Na^+$ ions tend to move into the neuron. Each ion moves in a direction that would shift the membrane potential toward its own equilibrium potential.\n","\n","\n","<font color='red'> **Solution 2**:</font>\n","\n","- Balancing Ion Fluxes:\n","\tThe membrane is more permeable to $K^+$ than to $Na^+$ at rest, meaning $K^+$ has a higher influence on $V_m$. The outward $K^+$ current is balanced by the inward $Na^+$ current. Although the driving force for $Na^+$ is greater, the lower permeability to $Na^+$ balances the effect. The continuous yet balanced movement of $K^+$ out and $Na^+$ in maintains a steady membrane potential without significant net ion flux.\n","- Role in Maintaining Resting Potential:\n","\tThe efflux of $K^+$ tends to hyperpolarize the membrane (make it more negative), pushing $V_m$ toward Eₖ. The influx of $Na^+$ tends to depolarize the membrane (make it more positive), pushing $V_m$ toward Eₙₐ. The opposing fluxes stabilize the membrane potential at -70 mV, a value between Eₖ and Eₙₐ.\n","\n","The resting membrane potential is maintained by the delicate balance between $K^+$ efflux and $Na^+$ influx. These ion movements counteract each other, resulting in minimal net ion flux and a stable $V_m$.\n","\n","\n","<font color='red'> **Solution 3**:</font>\n","\n","If the membrane permeability to $Na^+$ increases significantly while $K^+$ permeability remains constant:\n","\n","Increased $Na^+$ Influx:\n","\tMore $Na^+$ channels open, allowing more $Na^+$ ions to enter the cell. The large difference between $V_m$ and Eₙₐ continues to drive $Na^+$ into the cell.\n","Shift in Membrane Potential:\n","\tThe increased influx of positive $Na^+$ ions makes the inside of the cell more positive. $V_m$ moves toward the $Na^+$ equilibrium potential of +60 mV. While $K^+$ continues to exit the cell, the dominant $Na^+$ influx overpowers the $K^+$ efflux.\n","Physiological Implication:\n","  The depolarization may reach the threshold potential, triggering an action potential. Excitability Increase: The neuron becomes more excitable due to the decreased membrane potential difference.\n","\n","A significant increase in $Na^+$ permeability leads to depolarization of the neuron, shifting the membrane potential toward +60 mV. This change reduces the relative influence of $K^+$ efflux and can result in heightened neuronal activity.\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"cN-HItAG7wlb"},"source":["# 2.
